# Web-scraping using Beautiful Soup

## What is web scraping?
 Web scraping is nothing but a technique to collect data from websites. Currently data is comparable with crude oil. Data Scientist or Machine Learning Enginner needs data for various purpose. Many websites have data but they don't allow the user to collect data from personal use. Now user has two way to collect data : one is manually collect the data and it's time consuming, another way is web scraping. Web scraping is a automation process to extract data from websites.

#### Here I will use Python and Beautiful Soup to extract data from an website. 
In our code, we have extracted six types of attribute : 

Home team name as ht 
Away team name at
Home team posession as htp
Away team posession as atp
Home team score as hts
Away team score as ats

We have saved our extracted data into a csv file named data.csv.
